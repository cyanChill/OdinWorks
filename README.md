# OdinWorks

This is a app that functions similarly to Facebook. You can create an account and create posts (with images). You can search for other users using the search feature and send a friend request (in order to view their posts).

- A bonus is that you can sign-in with Facebook!
- There's also the option of signing into a shared demo account (by selecting the option on the login page).

> **Note:** It may take some time for the app to work as the backend running on fly.io may need to wake up.

## Running App Locally

To run this app locally, while in the current directory in a terminal:

### First start by running the backend.

1. Go to the `backend` folder (ie: `cd backend`).
2. Run `npm run devstart` to run the backend app in development mode.

> To run the backend in production mode, run `npm start` and make sure the `NODE_ENV` variable is set to `production`.

### Then start the frontend.

1. Open another terminal while in the project directory (containing the `backend` and `frontend` folders) and go to the `frontend` folder (ie: `cd frontend`).
2. Run `npm start` to start the app. Alternatively, you can build the app with `npm run build` and React will give you instructions on how to host the app in the `build` folder (that'll be created) using `serve`.
